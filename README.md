# Overview

This small project is a simple temperature conversion software written in the Rust language. I did this simple project so I could learn the basics 
of the Rust language. In the program I focused on covering the basics of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions. The functions are called and 
used after the user inputs their data and makes their selection.

To run the code you must have Cargo installed as well, and then change directory to the folder where the code is located then type in cargo run to your terminal.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my editor and used Rust as the primary language. I also used a tool called Cargo to create the framework of my rust files.

# Future Work

* Add some more conditionals with better logic
* Update interface to be more friendly
* Handle my inputs better so you don't need to convert variables.
